Federation Gateway Overview
===========================


The Acumos Federation Gateway feature provides a mechanism to exchange models
between two Acumos instances via a secure network channel.
The goal was to have a mechanism that provides great flexibility when designing a deployment.
The Gateway feature does not define how multiple Acumos instances are to be interconnected
or what roles they play.

Like many other system components, the Gateway is implemented as a server that listens
for requests on a REST API.  The Gateway provides two interfaces, both using REST:

* Public: towards peers (also known as the "E5" interface)
* Private: changes between gateway and different adapter implementations

Architecture
------------

The following picture shows how the gateway components communicate with each other and with
other Acumos features.  All communication is secured by use of client and server certificates.
