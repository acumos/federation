Selectors and Finding Solutions
-------------------------------

The Acumos federation gateway supports retrieving solutions from a peer
instance of Acumos.  Usually, though, what is desired is to retrieve a subset
of the solutions, and this is done by specifying a "selector" as a query
parameter on the HTTP GET from the peer federation gateway.  The value of the
selector is the Base64 encoding of a JSON object, with keys specifying
constraints on the set of solutions to be returned.  For example, to specify
that the name of the solution must be "hello," the JSON object might look like::

    {"name":"hello"}

The Base64 encoding of this is::

    eyJuYW1lIjoiaGVsbG8ifQ==

And the URL for an HTTP GET with this selector might be::

    https://example.org/solutions?selector=eyJuYW1lIjoiaGVsbG8ifQ%3D%3D

The keys supported in the selector object are:

* active

  Boolean, either true or false.  Defaults to true.  If true, only active
  solutions will be returned.  If false, only inactive solutions will be
  returned

* catalogId

  String.  If specified, only solutions from the specified catalog will be
  returned.

* modelTypeCode

  String or array of strings.  If specified, only solutions with one of the
  specified modelTypeCodes will be returned.

* modified

  Integer.  Defaults to 1.  A timestamp specified as the number of seconds since
  January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.  Only solutions modified at or after the
  specified timestamp will be returned.

* name

  String.  If specified, only solutions with the specified name will be
  returned.

* solutionId

  String.  If specified, only the specified solution will be returned.

* toolkitTypeCode

  String or array of strings.  If specified, only solutions with one of the
  specified toolkitTypeCodes will be returned.

* tags

  String or array of strings.  If specified, only solutions that have at
  least one of the specified tags will be returned.

Note: String comparison uses an exact match, only solutions that meet all of
the specified constraints will be returned, and a federation gateway can be
configured with additional default values as well as overrides of user
specified values.
