The files in this directory form an isolated 3 member TLS trust community,
suitable for testing client/server interactions using HTTPS with client
certificates.

When invoked with "acumosa", "acumosb", or "acumosc", the method
org.acumos.federation.client.test.ClientMocking.getConfig(name) will return
a ClientConfig object suitably populated to use these files.

The key stores, acumosa.pkcs12, acumosb.pkcs12, and acumosc.pkcs12, each contain
a private key and corresponding certificate, and can be used by either a client
or a server.

The trust store acumosTrustStore.jks contains the certificate authority
certificate referenced by the client certificates in the key store files.
